description: Healthy layout strategies for our ever changing & user generated content
overview: |
  2 game changing layout tactics are well supported these days, Flexbox and Grid. With
  these 2 at our fingertips, we can articulate layouts with less code and more strength.

  Sites that use flexbox and grid benefit from an improved developer authoring experience,
  but most of all benefit from the ability to be content centric. Defining layouts based on
  contraints, alignments and distributions can put more work on the CSS layout engine, and
  less work wherever else you're currently handling dynamic content and interactions.
