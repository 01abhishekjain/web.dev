# Overview
Heard this term yet in the context of web, [intrinsic](https://adactio.com/journal/13671)? I love it. No, like **loooooove** it, and I must **share** with you **the joy**.

Intrinsic has a few synonyms or alternative implecations and meanings I want to share quickly too, since I think they can really help you shape a mental model of what we're going for:
1. [Intrinsic Web Design](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/980980521848127488?lang=en)
1. [Content centric/outward](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/7-habits-of-highly-effective-media-queries/)
1. [Resilient](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/03/resilient-web-design/)
1. Courteous: okay, this one's mine ðŸ¤“

## Tangible Learning
Intrinsic definitions and articles get abstract, so instead of define it for you again, **I'd rather define it tangibly and visually** with you.

**We'll be laying out the following design** as a practical way of learning:

<figure style="text-align:center; margin: 5rem 0;">
  <img src="home.png" alt="TenHundred store home page" class="screenshot">
  <figcaption>Mock TenHundred store home page</figcaption>
</figure>


## Prepare to!
- lean into content variability: aka **assume text/images are out of our control**
- simulate some **chaos**: aka **simulate that lack of content control**
- lean into **[css grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)**
- **avoid [fixed units](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/)**
- flex [**css variables**](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/start-using-css-custom-properties/)
- respond to **mobile using our best judgement**
- use [tomorrow's CSS today](https://preset-env.cssdb.org)
- take a [Layout Challenge](#)


## Better Together
We'll acquire some bruises along the way as we bump our head, shoulders, knees and toes.. but I believe it's crucial for when y'all run into similar issues. That means this guide includes refactor reasoning and results. There's a lot of "play" that needs to happen with intrinsic layouts, **I want you to see how I play and reach resilient layouts.**

If you don't have the basics of grid or flexbox down, have no fear. **Y'all can pick up the basics & jargon along the way.** I'll do my best to provide links out to topics that I'm not going to cover, but will be referenced.
