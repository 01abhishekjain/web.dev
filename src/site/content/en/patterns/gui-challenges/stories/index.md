The HTML for the demo page can differ from the code samples displayed
in the code pattern tabs. To achieve this, include the full HTML for the page
in the demo.md file in the patterns directory, and ommit the layout property
in the frontmatter. You still neeed to include the patternId in the
frontmatter.
