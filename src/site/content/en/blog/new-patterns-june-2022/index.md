I'm excited to share there are many new [web.dev patterns](/patterns/). These
additions are all from my YouTube show [GUI
Challenges](https://goo.gle/GUIchallenges), where I share my strategies on how
to build various components and common interface needs, then collect user
submissions for the same tasks and help us all grow our perspectives on how to
solve them. Check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/argyleink/gui-challenges).

These solutions fit nicely into [patterns](/patterns/), see!

{% CodePattern 'gui-challenges/animation/interactive-words' %}

Now they can be embedded into posts (like above), or more importantly,
aggregated for easy browsing and inspiration!

## Overview

Three new pattern categories have been created and the centering challenges have
been added to the [layout patterns](/patterns/layout/):

1. [Components](/patterns/components/)
1. [Animations](/patterns/animation/)
1. [Theming](/patterns/theming/)

### Components

15 [component patterns](/patterns/components/) have been added. They range from
buttons (shown below) to loading bars to responsive hamburger side navigation.

{% CodePattern 'gui-challenges/buttons' %}

Take a look around or take some code, it's all there for you.

### Animations

Four [animation patterns](/patterns/animation/) have been added. For now it's
[split text](/building-split-text-animations/) patterns that only split and
animate if a user's system hasn't indicated reduced motion.

{% CodePattern 'gui-challenges/animation/animated-letters' %}

### Theming

Two theming patterns have been added. One is for building a client side [theme
switch](building-a-theme-switch-component/), so user's can indicate their
preference without it being directly tied to their system preference. The other
is for creating a [theming design system](/building-a-color-scheme/) with CSS
custom properties.

{% CodePattern 'gui-challenges/theming/color-schemes' %}

### New layout patterns on centering

Five new centering techniques have been added to the layout patterns. Each demo
features a grab handle to resize the container and a button to add a child to
the layout. These, as explained in [the article](/centering-in-css/), are to
help you feel the strengths and weaknesses of various centering styles the web
offers. Plus, they have fun names.

{% CodePattern 'gui-challenges/centering/gentle-flex' %}

## Wrap up

I hope these new patterns help teach you new techniques, inspire you, provide
insights into accessibility and overall keep you hyped on building UI. Stay
tuned for more patterns as the Chrome Team continues adding to these
collections.
