I'm excited to share [this collection of UI patterns](/patterns/gui-challenges/)
I've been building in the show GUI Challenges. The [web.dev
patterns](/patterns/) were such a great fit for presenting and sharing the
content. See!

{% CodePattern 'gui-challenges/animation/interactive-words' %}

## Overview

Four pattern categories have been created to share patterns from [GUI
Challenges](https://github.com/argyleink/gui-challenges):
[components](/patterns/gui-challenges/#:~:text=Layout%20Patterns-,Animation,-Animated%20Letters),
animations, centering and theming.
