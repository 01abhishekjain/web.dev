If users ever need to log in to your site, then good sign-up form design is
critical. This is especially true for people on poor connections, on mobile, in
a hurry, or under stress. Poorly designed sign-up forms get high bounce rates.
Each bounce could mean a lost and disgruntled userâ€”not just a missed sign-up
opportunity.

  If you would prefer to learn these best practices with a hands-on tutorial,
  check out the [Sign-up form best practices codelab](/codelab-sign-up-form-best-practices).
{% endAside %}

Here is an example of a very simple sign-up form that demonstrates all of the best practices:

{% Glitch {
  id: 'signup-form',
  path: 'index.html',
  height: 480
} %}

This post is about form best practices. It does not explain how to build
backend services to authenticate users, store their credentials, or manage their
accounts. [12 best practices for user account, authorization and password
management](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/12-best-practices-for-user-account)
outlines core back-end principles for managing user accounts.

This post also doesn't explain how to provide sign-up via an identity provider, though (as explained 
below) you should do that for your site.
